# 2d-polarization_dependence.py
Generates a dataset for analyzing the 2D dependence of θ (incident electric field vector angle) on ϕ (scattered electric field vector angle) for a given Raman tensor.
---
The output includes:
- 2D graph of dot product values for all θ and ϕ combinations.
- 2D graph of cross product values for all θ and ϕ combinations.
- 2D graph of ccattered Raman intensity for all θ and ϕ combinations.
